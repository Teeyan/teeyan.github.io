### Daniel Tian

Hello friends. Why start from scratch when we have whole templates, starter code as it were, to base off of?

This raggedy blog is for me to self-masturbatorily reflect on my own day to day life and recoup my thinking on various schools of thought / their relation to my day to day life.

Feeling lost and just need somewhere to reflect so if you come across this, rifle through some content and see if you can help out.
