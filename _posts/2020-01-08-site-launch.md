## It's all about me.

Philosophy in all its forms, fervently outspoken doctrines, awe inspiring idealogies, the ultimate goal remains the same. Conquering the fear of death.

If we take "philosophy" at face value as the "love of wisdom", the meaning seems to imply that wisdom is found in discovering what lies beyond, and indeed for myself, I've found an all to human obsession with this timeless task as of late.

I come from a nondenominational Christian family, I was raised in the faith and to this day for the most part consider myself to be a part of the related religious community. But contemporary interpretations of the traditional Christian doctrine vary and all more or less originate from man-made retellings of the original Scriptures. This led to inevitable doubt and a desire to go explore new perspectives in hope of reformulating my own. A deep dive into application of Kant's concept of an "enlarged horizon" if you will.

Thus relays the purpose of my writing. To collect my thoughts and hopefully reflect and discover new insights into previously studied doctrines from my academic days and the present. Think of it as a cohesive way of note taking that keeps my degenerate mind entertained when I look back in hopes that I don't think "wow, what an absolute twat I was".

Given my recurring trend of ineptitude and general stuipidity, content will be amateur at best. That's a promise.

## 3 Simple Steps For Indoctrination

As I look at mankind's plays on thought throughout our collective history, in my future posts I'd like to break each one presented into three primary pieces. Credits to Luc Ferry in his excellent primer for philosophy that I read in my highschool days, *A Brief History of Thought* for this approach to analysis. Excellent book, I encourage rereading, the only detraction being Ferry's own opinions on life permeate throughout.

Going to our 3 step analysis, the first being that of theoria. Greek for contemplation, this is the first step to constructing a new methodology of thought. Make a statement about the intrinsic nature of the world and how the common man interacts within it. What is the inherent form of the universe, and how is it that the individual observes it to be so?

Following that will be ethics. What are our rules of engagement? With the swirling chaos given form, what then is actionable? We need guidelines to follow in our day to day interactions with, not just our fellow man, but the universe in its entirety. 

Finally, we arrive at what it's all about (for me personally I admit with much chagrin), **salvation**. The final answer, that for many cases, has been the deciding factor between the rise and fall of various schools of thought throughout millenia. What lies beyond? Given the nature of our universe and the guidelines we follow, what is the end result? 

Looking over the process, the majority of my focus has been geared towards salvation. Is the proposed notion within reason? Does it present a truly satisfactory endgame? Whether the salvation is personal, impersonal, or purely shrouded by the necessity for a "change in perspective", its validity remains ambiguous. Abashedly, I hold that such ambiguity reigns as the greatest curse that will ever be afflicted upon mankind.

## Looking Forward ...

I'll post as frequently as I like, when new thoughts come up or I just need to vent a bit. If you stumble upon this by whatever odd reason hopefully it can help with developing your own enlarged thoughts. Don't hesitate to reach out and banter, it could help greatly.

Even if we resent a particular doctrine, whether that be Christianity, Communism, etc. that's all the more reason to truly and judiciously study them. Knowledge is a gift that comes with its own set of prerogatives and expectations. To remain willfully ignorant is wholly detrimental to our own development.

Exploration of that which differs from our current world state is imperative and furthers our understanding. Why recreate that which has been developed for eons before us by men who truly exercised the gifts given to them?

I pray for triumph over Metu Mortis.
