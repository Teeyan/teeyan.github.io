# Theoria and Other Boring Existentialisms

Why start from scratch when we have whole templates, starter code as it were, to base off of?

This shitty blog is for me to self-masturbatorily reflect on my own day to day lives and recoup my thinking on various schools of thoughts and their relation to my day to day life.

I'm lost as shit and just need somewhere to reflect so if you come across this, rifle through some content and see if you can help out.
